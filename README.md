## virus-avengers

**How it works**

We start by choosing our player i.e. the avenger.
By clicking Start Game we will see our player and the game canvas.
Our player can jump (press space or up arrow) to avoid the virus that comes towards him/her.
Every virus successfully avoided will add a point to our score.
Every 6 points in our score will make the game level up.
When we change level, we get a new continent as a background and virus start coming faster.
After Game Over we can click on Play Again and start over.
